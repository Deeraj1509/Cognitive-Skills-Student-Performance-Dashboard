Student Performance Dashboard
A comprehensive web-based analytics platform for visualizing and analyzing student cognitive skills and academic performance. This project combines data science techniques with interactive web visualization to provide educators with actionable insights about student learning patterns.
Project Overview
The Student Performance Dashboard processes synthetic student data to identify learning patterns, predict academic performance, and categorize students into distinct learning personas. The system uses machine learning algorithms for performance prediction and clustering analysis to group students based on their cognitive skill profiles.
Features

Installation and Setup
Prerequisites

Python 3.8 or higher
Node.js 14 or higher
npm or yarn package manager

Backend Setup

Navigate to the project root directory
Install Python dependencies:

bash   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn jupyter joblib plotly

Launch Jupyter Notebook:

bash   cd backend
   jupyter notebook

Open and run student_analysis.ipynb to process data and train models

Frontend Setup

Navigate to the frontend directory:

bash   cd frontend

Install Node.js dependencies:

bash   npm install

Install development dependencies:

bash   npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer

Initialize Tailwind CSS:

bash   npx tailwindcss init -p

Copy processed data from backend:

bash   cp ../backend/processed_data/student_processed.json public/data/

Start the development server:

bash   npm run dev

Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000

Data Description
The project uses a synthetic dataset containing the following student attributes:

student_id: Unique identifier for each student
name: Student name
class: Academic class or grade level
comprehension: Reading and understanding ability score (0-100)
attention: Attention span and focus level (0-100)
focus: Sustained concentration ability (0-100)
retention: Information retention and recall capacity (0-100)
engagement_time: Time spent in active learning (minutes)
assessment_score: Overall academic performance score (0-100)

Key Findings
Correlation Analysis
The analysis reveals that comprehension shows the strongest correlation with assessment scores, indicating that reading and understanding abilities are critical predictors of academic success.
Machine Learning Model
The linear regression model achieves an R-squared score of 0.773, demonstrating strong predictive capability for student assessment scores based on cognitive skill inputs.
Learning Personas
Three distinct student groups were identified through clustering analysis:

Developing Learners: Students with moderate skills showing steady progress
Focused Performers: High-performing students with strong attention and focus
Support Needed: Students requiring additional academic intervention

Usage Instructions
Accessing the Dashboard

Ensure both backend data processing and frontend server are running
Navigate to http://localhost:3000 in your web browser
The main dashboard displays comprehensive analytics and visualizations

Exploring Student Data

Use the search functionality to find specific students
Sort columns by clicking on table headers
Click on student names to view individual profiles
Analyze learning personas and recommendations in the dedicated section

Interpreting Visualizations

Bar Chart: Compare average cognitive skills across learning clusters
Scatter Plot: Examine relationship between attention and performance
Radar Chart: View multi-dimensional cognitive skill profiles

Development and Customization
Adding New Features
The modular architecture allows for easy extension of functionality. New chart components can be added to the components directory, and additional analysis can be incorporated into the Jupyter notebook.
Data Updates
To use different datasets, replace the student_data.csv file and ensure column names match the expected format. Re-run the backend analysis to generate updated processed data.
Styling Customization
The frontend uses Tailwind CSS for styling. Modify the tailwind.config.js file to customize colors, spacing, and other design elements.

Performance Considerations
The dashboard is optimized for datasets up to 1000+ student records. For larger datasets, consider implementing pagination in the data table and lazy loading for visualizations.
Browser Support
The application supports modern web browsers including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge. JavaScript must be enabled for full functionality.
